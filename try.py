
# pytest is the module that provides us with testing helper functions.
# Mostly not needed initially, but you'll call on it in some cases.
# See documentation on pytest.

# Note that the procedures below that are testing for things **must**
# have their names start with "test_" ... just as this file's name
# also starts with "test_". `pytest` will automatically pick up
# such functions and run them when you run `uvx pytest` from the
# command line.
